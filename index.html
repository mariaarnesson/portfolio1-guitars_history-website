            <h1>Hello!</h1>
                <p>Welcome to my website! I would like to tell you about a very interesting instrument which is the guitar.
                   I will describe the different types of guitars and their history. What is interesting about the guitar is that 
                   there are many artists who use them in very different types of music. The guitar made history for Blues and Rock in Roll. 
                   But the guitar is also found in many other types of music, such as pop and jazz</p>

            <h1>Guitar</h1>
                <p>Guitar, plucked stringed musical instrument that probably originated in Spain early in the 16th century,
                   deriving from the guitarra latina, a late-medieval instrument with a waisted body and four strings. 
                   The early guitar was narrower and deeper than the modern guitar, with a less pronounced waist.
                   It was closely related to the vihuela, the guitar-shaped instrument played in Spain in place of the lute.
        
                   The guitar originally had four courses of strings, three double, the top course single,
                   that ran from a violin-like pegbox to a tension bridge glued to the soundboard, or belly;
                   the bridge thus sustained the direct pull of the strings. In the belly was a circular sound hole, 
                   often ornamented with a carved wooden rose. The 16th-century guitar was tuned C-F-A-D',
                   the tuning of the centre four courses of the lute and of the vihuela.</p>
