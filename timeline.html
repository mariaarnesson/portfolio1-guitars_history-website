            <h2>1817-1892 Classical guitar</h2>
            <p>Classical guitars, also known as "Spanish" guitars, are typically strung with nylon strings, plucked with the fingers, 
                played in a seated position and are used to play a diversity of musical styles including classical music.</p>

             <p>Flat-top guitars with steel strings are similar to the classical guitar, however, 
                the flat-top body size is usually significantly larger than a classical guitar, and has a narrower, 
                reinforced neck and stronger structural design.</p>

             <p>Resonator guitars were similar to the flat top guitar in appearance, but with a body that may be made of brass, 
                nickel-silver, or steel as well as wood,
                the sound of the resonator guitar is produced by one or more aluminum resonator cones mounted in the middle of the top</p>

            <h2>1932 Electric guitar</h2>
            <p>Electric guitars can have solid, semi-hollow, or hollow bodies; solid bodies produce little sound without amplification. 
                In contrast to a standard acoustic guitar, electric guitars instead rely on electromagnetic pickups, 
                and sometimes piezoelectric pickups, that convert the vibration of the steel strings into signals,
                which are fed to an amplifier through a patch cable or radio transmitter. </p>
